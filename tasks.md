Tasks

Data Cleaning and preparation:
1. Missing values
2. date_time format
3. categorical feature that needs to be encoded into numerical format

Feature Engineering (Create/Remove feature from available data):

1. Age Extraction: We'll unveil the age of each customer by deciphering their birth year from the "Year_Birth."
2. Spending Power: Introducing "Spent," a dynamic feature showcasing the total expenditure across various categories over the past two years.
3. Household Living Arrangement: craft "Living_With" from "Marital_Status," revealing the living arrangements of  valued couples.
4. Family Dynamics: "Children" will emerge, quantifying the number of children in a household, encompassing both the young ones and teenagers.
5. Family Unity: "Family_Size" will take shape, providing insights into the size and structure of each household.
6. Parental Status: "Is_Parent" will be born, simplifying the journey of parenthood for our customers.
7. Educational Evolution: "Education" will undergo a transformation, restructured into three distinct categories for clarity.
8. Farewell to Redundancy: We'll bid adieu to redundant features, streamlining our dataset for a sleek and insightful analysis.

Data Preparation
1. Label Encoding: Translate categorical features into numbers so that your algorithms can work their magic.
2. Scaling: Using the standard scaler to put all features on the same playing field, making it easier for your algorithms to do their thing.
3. Dimensionality Reduction: Creating a smaller, more manageable subset of data, simplifying the complexity for smoother analysis. (may or may not be used)

Clustering
key milestones:
1. Elbow Method: We'll pinpoint the ideal number of clusters.
2. Agglomerative Clustering: The heart of our clustering journey.
3. Scatter Plot Revelations: We'll unveil the cluster patterns using scatter plots. 

Visualization 
1. you may use scatterplots, swarmplot, boxenplot to evaluate your clustering models
2. draw distribution of cluster chart
3. profiling between income and spending cluster
